# 👋 Hi, I’m Suhana Gupta

I’m a developer studying computer science and mathematics. Mainly, I am passionate about building projects around human experiences, solving real-time problems by combining technology, creativity, and design.

💡 Currently exploring how **AI** and **data-driven design** can intersect to create more intuitive and expressive digital tools.
